Thanks for checking out our tic-tac-toe game! More information about this project is below.

Authors: Kalib Watson, Ross Klimoski, Stephanie Walker
Course: AL 491, Michigan State University
Professor: Brian Adams

                                                                          Walkthrough
Creating the HTML & CSS
<<<<<<< HEAD
        - Ross made home page
        - Stephanie made game page
        - Kalib added final touches, including the CSS of the actual game board
        - We had to figure out how to get the css files into the correct folder on gitlab
        - We made sketches of what wanted pages to look like before actually coding the pages (show image below)
        - Found it was helpful to type our code in a separate text editor (I used Atom) and then copying and pasting it into the correct files within$


Core code(Kalib)
        - Set up gitlab
        - Coded the php


Challenges faced
        - adding data to database
        - retrieving data from database
        - checking items in the table
        - lack of resources, troubleshooting issues
        - MySQL understanding

Future Improvements
        - fixing the broken code
        - displaying a user’s scores on the game page
        - sorting the scores on the score page buy highest-lowest score

In order to start working on our project:
	- SSH into your fws space 
	- Copy the SSH URL from the gitlab project page
	- Cd into your public_html directory and run git clone <the URL you copied> 
	- The project will take a minute to clone
	- Cd into the tictactoe directory
	- Run composer to install dependencies with composer install command
	- Answer yes to any composer questions
	- Check your fws http space and make sure the page comes up
	- Run the create_user_schema <your database name> command
	- Edit the config/app.php with your database credentials
	- Run bin/cake migrations migrate to get your database tables
	_ Start developing!

To work on our application, clone the repository URL, run composer install, then create user schema and use migrations. Once you are part of the project, browse through the
http://fws.cal.msu.edu:8080/~<netID>/ URL and the GitLab repository to familiarize yourself with the files.
