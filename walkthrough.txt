                                                                          Walkthrough
Creating the HTML & CSS
        - Ross made home page
        - Stephanie made game page
        - Kalib added final touches, including the CSS of the actual game board
        - We had to figure out how to get the css files into the correct folder on gitlab
        - We made sketches of what wanted pages to look like before actually coding the pages (show image below)
        - Found it was helpful to type our code in a separate text editor (I used Atom) and then copying and pasting it into the correct files within$


Core code(Kalib)
        - Set up gitlab
        - Coded the php


Challenges faced
        - adding data to database
        - retrieving data from database
        - checking items in the table
        - lack of resources, troubleshooting issues
        - MySQL understanding

Future Improvements
        - fixing the broken code
        - displaying a userâ€™s scores on the game page
        - sorting the scores on the score page buy highest-lowest score
