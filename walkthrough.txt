                                                                          Walkthrough
Creating the HTML & CSS
	- Ross made home page
	- Stephanie made game page
	- Kalib added final touches, including the CSS of the actual game board
	- We had to figure out how to get the css files into the correct folder on gitlab
	- We made sketches of what wanted pages to look like before actually coding the pages (show image below) 
	- Found it was helpful to type our code in a separate text editor (I used Atom) and then copying and pasting it into the correct files within terminal


Core code(Kalib)
	- Set up gitlab
	- Coded the php

 
Challenges faced
	- adding data to database
	- retrieving data from database
	- checking items in the table
	- lack of resources, troubleshooting issues
	- MySQL understanding

Future Improvements
	- fixing the broken code
	- displaying a userâ€™s scores on the game page
	- sorting the scores on the score page buy highest-lowest score


To work on our application, clone the repository URL, run composer install, then create user schema and use migrations. Once you are part of the project, browse through the
http://fws.cal.msu.edu:8080/~<netID>/ URL and the GitLab repository to familiarize yourself with the files.
